    Analyzes a DataFrame containing information about specific smell and returns a list of top entities with smell distribution
    based on total smell count.

    :param df: DataFrame containing the smell information.
    :param smell_type: The main smell type to be considered (e.g., 'Design Smell', 'Implementation Smell').
    :param smell_subtypes: List defining subtypes of the specified smell_type. This will be considered for smell_distribution.
    :param concat_column: The name of the column in the DataFrame that contains concatenated project, package, type name (and method name).
    :param top: The number of top entities to return. Default is 10.
    :return: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents an entity and includes:
             - The entity's concatenated column value,
             - A dictionary of smell distribution for each subtype,
             - The total number of smells associated with the entity.
            The list will be in descending order based on the total smell count of each entity.
